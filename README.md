# Cricket-Schedule-Designer
Automatically generates matches between two random teams
Each time the program executes match making between pairs will be different.
After we make match between two teams we have to re-adjust the number of teams(yet to get matched) for better optimisation of code.
Inorder to reduce the number of teams linked list will be one of the best ways possible.
